# ALEXA IoT

The aim of this project is study the IoT Alexa technology, MQTT and the esp8266 component. 

### SET THE CONNECTION CREDENTIALS

In order to set the internet connection credentials we have to rename the credentials.h.sample to credentials.h and set the correct information.

### UPLOAD THE CODE

First of all we need a little but powerful component called ESP8266 and a ESP01 Programmer Adapter for uploading the code into the component. 
Then open the Arduino IDE and load the sketch. Set the name of the component in the variable ID_SENSOR and then set the thingspeak.com API credentials too.

### DISCOVER THE DEVICE

After the uploading of the code in the ESP8266, we have to use the Alexa App in order to add it!
